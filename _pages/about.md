I am a third-year Ph.D. student at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign, where I am fortunate to be advised by [Chandra Chekuri](https://chekuri.cs.illinois.edu/) and [Karthekeyan Chandrasekaran](https://karthik.ise.illinois.edu/). My research interests lie in approximation algorithms, graph algorithms, combinatorial optimization, and submodular optimization.

Previously, I did my undergrad at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. During my junior year, I worked as an undergraduate researcher at Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, where I worked closely with [Bundit Laekhanukit](https://bundit-lae.me/).

You can see my CV [here](/assets/pdf/WeihaoZhu_CV.pdf). Please feel free to reach out if you have any question!
